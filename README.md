# OCEAN Badges

Visual personality badges based on the Big Five (OCEAN) model.

This project is a **fork and extension** of the original **bigfive-web** project,
focused on transforming Big Five test results into clean, shareable visual artifacts
(SVG / PNG badges).

## What is this?

OCEAN Badges is a small web service that generates **visual personality badges**
based on Big Five test results.

The goal is not diagnosis or evaluation, but **visual reflection** —
a compact, human-readable way to express personality tendencies and start conversations.

Badges are designed to be:

- visually neutral
- non-judgmental
- easy to share
- easy to embed

---

## Why badges?

Text-heavy personality reports are hard to compare, discuss, or reference in social contexts.

A visual badge:

- lowers the barrier to communication
- helps people explain themselves without oversharing
- acts as a *conversation interface*, not a label

This project explores how **visual abstraction** can improve
human-to-human and human-to-system interaction.

---

## Social & research context

This project can be seen as a **social visualization experiment**.

One possible future direction is the use of lightweight personality signals
in **hybrid systems**, where humans and AI agents interact as peers:

- humans as agents
- AI systems as agents
- shared interfaces for preferences, communication styles, and constraints

In such systems, *representation matters more than raw data*.

OCEAN Badges explore one possible representation.

---

## Privacy & data handling

This project is designed with **privacy by default**:

- No user accounts
- No personal identification
- No linkage between badges and real identities
- No tracking or profiling
- Badge IDs are random and anonymous

The service does **not store or infer personal data**
beyond the minimal information required to render a badge.

---

## Ethical note (intended use)

Big Five results are **probabilistic and context-dependent**.

Badges generated by this project are intended for:

- personal reflection
- education
- communication

They should **not** be used as the sole basis for:

- hiring decisions
- employee evaluation
- segregation or discrimination

This is a statement of intent, not a legal restriction.

---

## Technical overview

- Next.js (App Router)
- SVG-first rendering (shareable SVG + Instagram-ready PNG)
- Redis for temporary result storage
- Docker-ready
- No authentication required

---

## Who might find this useful?

- **Teams (especially remote ones)**  
  A lightweight way to understand communication styles without long
  “tell me about yourself” calls or documents.

- **Gamification enthusiasts**  
  Turning personality traits into “stats” of a character is a well-known and
  effective way to increase engagement and self-reflection.

- **Interface & UX researchers**  
  An experiment in how complex psychological information can be represented
  in a compact, visual, and shareable form.

---

## AI agents & human interaction (future direction)

In future hybrid systems, where humans and AI systems interact as peers,
AI agents may benefit from lightweight, voluntary personality signals.

Not as identifiers or profiles, but as **interaction metadata** —
contextual hints about communication style, preferences, and tendencies.

OCEAN Badges explore one possible form of such metadata:
compact, visual, non-authoritative, and explicitly non-diagnostic.

The goal is not classification of people,
but reduction of friction in human–AI and human–human interaction.

---

## How to run (Docker)

The application lives in the `web/` directory.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Run locally

```bash
cd web
docker compose up --build
```

After startup, the application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Environment variables (Redis, etc.) are configured via `docker-compose.yml`.

## Origin & attribution

This project is a fork of:

- **bigfive-web** (upstream):  
  https://github.com/alheimsins/bigfive-web

The upstream project is based on:

- IPIP-NEO-PI: https://github.com/kholia/IPIP-NEO-PI
- Item/test data from: http://ipip.ori.org

This fork focuses specifically on **visualization and sharing**,
which was not the original goal of the upstream project.
