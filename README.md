# OCEAN Badges

Visual personality badges based on the Big Five (OCEAN) model.

This project is a **fork and extension** of the original **bigfive-web** project, focused on transforming Big Five test results into clean, shareable visual artifacts (SVG / PNG badges).

---

## What is this?

OCEAN Badges is a small web service that generates **visual personality badges** based on Big Five test results.

The goal is not diagnosis or evaluation, but **visual reflection** — a compact, human-readable way to express personality tendencies and start conversations.

Badges are designed to be:

- visually neutral
- non-judgmental
- easy to share
- easy to embed

---

## Why badges?

Text-heavy personality reports are hard to compare, discuss, or reference in social contexts.

A visual badge:

- lowers the barrier to communication
- helps people explain themselves without oversharing
- acts as a *conversation interface*, not a label

This project explores how **visual abstraction** can improve human-to-human and human-to-system interaction.

---

## Social & research context

This project can be seen as a **social visualization experiment**.

One possible future direction is the use of lightweight personality signals in **hybrid systems**, where humans and AI agents interact as peers:

- humans as agents
- AI systems as agents
- shared interfaces for preferences, communication styles, and constraints

In such systems, *representation matters more than raw data*.

OCEAN Badges explore one possible representation.

---

## Privacy & data handling

This project is designed with **privacy by default**:

- No user accounts
- No personal identification
- No linkage between badges and real identities
- No tracking or profiling
- Badge IDs are random and anonymous

The service does **not store or infer personal data** beyond the minimal information required to render a badge.

---

## Ethical note (intended use)

Big Five results are **probabilistic and context-dependent**.

Badges generated by this project are intended for:

- personal reflection
- education
- communication

They should **not** be used as the sole basis for:

- hiring decisions
- employee evaluation
- segregation or discrimination

This is a statement of intent, not a legal restriction.

---

## Technical overview

- Next.js (App Router)
- SVG-first rendering (shareable SVG + Instagram-ready PNG)
- Redis for temporary result storage
- Docker-ready
- No authentication required

---

## Origin & attribution

This project is a fork of:

- **bigfive-web** (upstream): https://github.com/alheimsins/bigfive-web

The upstream project is based on:

- IPIP-NEO-PI: https://github.com/kholia/IPIP-NEO-PI
- Item/test data from: http://ipip.ori.org

This fork focuses specifically on **visualization and sharing**, which was not the original goal of the upstream project.
